/**
 * Prisma Database Client Singleton
 *
 * This file creates a singleton instance of PrismaClient to prevent
 * multiple database connections in development mode (Next.js hot reload).
 *
 * Key Concepts:
 * - Singleton Pattern: Ensures only one PrismaClient instance exists
 * - Development Optimization: Reuses client across hot reloads
 * - Production: Creates new instance on each serverless function invocation
 *
 * Why Singleton?
 * - Next.js development mode can create multiple PrismaClient instances during hot reload
 * - Multiple instances = multiple database connections = connection pool exhaustion
 * - Storing client in globalThis prevents this issue in development
